# FloatingGroupExpandableListView
FloatingGroupExpandableListView is ~~a huge name~~ an open source Android library that provides a floating group view (*aka* anchored / pinned / sticky section header) at the top of the `ExpandableListView`. This lib is based on Emil Sj√∂lander's [StickyListHeaders](https://github.com/emilsjolander/StickyListHeaders).

![Sample Screenshot](https://github.com/diegocarloslima/FloatingGroupExpandableListView/raw/master/sample.png)&nbsp;![Sample Animation](https://github.com/diegocarloslima/FloatingGroupExpandableListView/raw/master/sample_animation.gif)

## Features
- Works with list headers, footers, dividers and padding.
- Works with partially transparent or hidden group views.
- Handles touch events on the floating group view properly.
- Allows group transition animation.

## Sample Application
[![Get it on Google Play](http://www.android.com/images/brand/get_it_on_play_logo_small.png)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.diegocarloslima.fgelv.sample)

The sample app project code is also included on this repository.

## Usage
The FloatingGroupExpandableListView is very easy to setup. You just need a few steps:

1. Add the `FloatingGroupExpandableListView` to your xml file. It will look something like this:

    ```xml
    <com.diegocarloslima.fgelv.lib.FloatingGroupExpandableListView
    android:id="@+id/my_list"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="match_parent"/>
    ```

2. Then add these lines to your java code (usually on your `Activity.onCreate()` or `Fragment.onCreateView()` method):

    ```java
    FloatingGroupExpandableListView myList = (FloatingGroupExpandableListView) findViewById(R.id.my_list);
    BaseExpandableListAdapter myAdapter = new MyAdapter();
    WrapperExpandableListAdapter wrapperAdapter = new WrapperExpandableListAdapter(myAdapter);
    myList.setAdapter(wrapperAdapter);
    ```

3. That's it! You're ready to go! For a complete implementation, you can take a look at the sample project.

## Gradle
Add the following dependency to your `build.gradle` file:

```groovy
dependencies {
    compile 'com.diegocarloslima:fgelv:0.1.+@aar'
}
```
